# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Overview
This project is a simple HTML/CSS homework assignment. The codebase consists of static files only:
- `index.html`: Main HTML file for the assignment
- `style.css`: Stylesheet for the HTML page

## Architecture
- No JavaScript, backend, or build system is present.
- All logic is contained in the HTML and CSS files.
- The project structure is flat and minimal, with all files in the `homework_2_3` directory.

## Developer Workflows
- **Preview**: Open `index.html` directly in a browser to view changes.
- **Edit**: Modify `index.html` and `style.css` as needed. No compilation or build steps required.
- **Debug**: Use browser developer tools to inspect and debug layout or style issues.

## Project-Specific Conventions
- All styles are written in a single `style.css` file. Inline styles are discouraged.
- Semantic HTML is preferred (use appropriate tags for structure).
- Class and ID naming should be descriptive and consistent.
- No external dependencies or frameworks are used.

## Integration Points
- No external APIs, libraries, or build tools are integrated.
- All resources are local and referenced directly from HTML.

## Examples
- To add a new section, create a semantic HTML element in `index.html` and style it in `style.css`.
- To change the layout, update the relevant CSS selectors in `style.css`.

## Key Files
- `homework_2_3/index.html`: Main entry point
- `homework_2_3/style.css`: All styles

## How to Be Productive
- Focus on clear, maintainable HTML structure and CSS rules.
- Use browser preview for immediate feedback.
- Follow existing naming and structural patterns.
